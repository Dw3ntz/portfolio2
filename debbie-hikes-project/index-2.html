                        <p id="aboutme"><strong>About the Author:</strong><br>I'm a born &amp; raised Washington gal. I hang around with two dogs, one cat, and currently reside in Seattle. I am a weekday student &amp; barista and a weekend adventurer. Walking through the woods, sleeping under the stars, eating rehydrated macaroni &amp; cheese, I have uncovered an insurmountable comfort and peace, as the low hum of the earth beneath me reminds me of my insignificance. I truly enjoy being in the wilderness, as well as meeting and connecting with wonderful strangers and new friends on the trail!</p>
