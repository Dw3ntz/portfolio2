                                <h3>About the Album:</h3>
                                    <p>AM is arguably, from end to end, the most complete album the Arctic Monkeys has released. AM was released in fall 2013 and I have been referring back to this album ever since. This album really tells a story of the wild nights the band has experienced as well as the surface level experiences that at times weigh on the mind. This album is a classic and a favorite of mine to jam to, especially while driving simply because the lyrics are so visual. It's almost impossible to decide which track from this record is my favorite but I would have to start with <em>I Wanna Be Yours</em>, followed by <em>Arabella</em> &amp; <em>No. 1 Party Anthem</em>. Even as I type this my mind is screaming to bring up the dynamic songs <em>Do I Wanna Know?</em> &amp; <em>R U Mine?</em>. If you want to hear some creative and imaginative lyrics, give those last two I mentioned a listen or read.

                                <h3>About the Artist:</h3>
                                    <p>Alex Turner, Jamie Cook, Nick O'Malley, and Matt Helders make up Arctic Monkeys. Alex Turner being the lead vocalist/guitarist/pianist and the most recognizable for the band. The band came together in 2002, and since their formation they have released 6 albums. Their latest album <em>Tranquility Base Hotel and Casino</em> took the imagination of <em>AM</em> and expanded that creativity throughout outerspace and didn't bring us back down. Arctic Monkeys are a dynamic and evocative group that are sure to continue to create great records for as long as they are able.
