                                <h3>About the Album:</h3>
                                    <p>The Black Keys have been an all-time favorite band of mine since their first albums were released. The grunge, the rock, and the blues rolled into a perfect team that has made masterful albums one right after the other, and with many of the albums being top rated in my personal opinion, Attack and Release has to be my very favorite. If I had to pick a favorite track from this record it would have to be <em>All You Ever Wanted</em>, followed by <em>Remember When (A &amp; B)</em>, and <em>Things Ain't Like They Used to Be</em>. Attack and Release is an album that drives me to face my life for what it is and accept what I cannot change, and forgive myself for my regrets. It's also just an incredible record to rock out to, but the pensive lyrics will force any listener or reader to consider the paths their lives have walked.
                                    </p>
                                <h3>About the Artist:</h3>
                                    <p>Dan Auerbach and Patrick Carney make up The Black Keys. This incredible combination of musicians came together in the early 2000s in Ohio and released their first record in 2002. They have been making steady popular records together up until their latest release <em>"Let's Rock"</em> which came out in 2019. The band has had songs featured in motion pictures and recently wrapped up a U.S. tour. Dan Auerbach has released his own music as a solo artist but there is no argument that can combat my opinion that these two musicians create true magic together.
