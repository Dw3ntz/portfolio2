                                        <p>Hi internet friends! Welcome to my webpage, The Sound. I have created this website as a project for my CIS300 class at <a href="https://go.asuonline.asu.edu/">Arizona State University</a>. I would like to invite you to peruse these webpages which feature six musical albums that have meant a great deal to me in my life, at a time of extreme growth or difficulty. <br><br> For those of us that enjoy it, music is a very powerful art form that can help us to express ourselves when we may not always know how. These six albums have touched my soul and helped me during trying times and if you feel so inclined I'd love for you to reach out to me below, to connect about music, life, or just to say hi! Enjoy!<br><br>- Debbie Wentz.
